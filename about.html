      <h3>Why institutional communication needs structure</h3>
      <p class="muted">
        Most communication platforms are designed for open networks and informal interaction.
        Institutions operate differently — with ownership, responsibility, and accountability.
        Querily Labs builds systems that align communication with how institutions actually function.
